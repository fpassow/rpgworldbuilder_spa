<h1>RPG World Builder</h1>

    <a href="rpgworldbuilder.html" target="_blank">Try it!</a>
</div>

<p>Do you have ideas for role-playing games, but wonder if you can turn
them into something you can really play with your friends?</p>

<p>Are you an experienced GM, who has run a few different rules systems,
and maybe one or two you've created yourself?</p>

<p>If you answered yes to both questions above, this site is for you. The tool on the next page
will help you flesh out you idea, and help ensure that it has what it takes to drive weeks of 
enjoyable campaigning.</p>

<p>I call this a world builder and a campaign creator because it's about setting and situation, not rules.
You already have books full of rules. You can get free and universal systems online. And you can probably write some yourself if you have to.</p>

<p>The hard part is to come up with ideas that are:</p>
<ol><li>Creative and exciting</li><li>Practical and playable</li></ol>

<p>Below, I list the fields on the form and explain what they are and how they work.</p>

<p>You can create an account to save your work. And if you create an account, you can also
clone and modify other peoples' ideas, or add them into your own.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Clone: </strong> Copy all the text from any campaign into a new campaign owned by your own account.</li>
    <li><strong>Add-To: </strong> Copy all the text from any campaign and add it, field by field, to a campaign that already exists in your own account.</li>
</ul>

<p>On to the fields...</p>

<div class="field">
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Always include a working title. It's evocative. And it's the name that appears on a saved campaign.
    And you can change it any time you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Seed Text</h2>
    <p>Images, concepts, fragments, design goals, movie references, songs... anything. Record everything
    that is resonating with you and might become part of the campaign.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>It's easier to have exciting events in the PCs'
    lives when the world itself is changing. For a shorter campaign, a change
    can define the setting. War, exploration, the rise of magic, the vanishing of magic, or the
    Zombie Apocylipse. Don't be afraid to drop the PCs into Interesting Times(TM).</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Mood</h2>
    <p>Grim, exciting, zany, lyrical, tactical, dream-like, happy, sad, desperate, exuberant, etc. How will the players feel?</p>
    <p>Your game will produce <em>some</em> feeling. So make it intentional.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Visual Style</h2>
    <p>How do you see it in your mind? Does it look like a favorite movie, comic, artist, etc.?</p>
    <p>You can use this as inspiration for many details later on.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>A city, a planet, a war, a subculture, etc.</p>
    <p>Try larger or smaller physical scopes than you are used to.</p>
    <p>And scope isn't just an area on a map. A single great city could be the setting for campaigns about
    court intrigue, ambition among wizards, and about shape changers living in the shadows and sewers. But the limits and rules and social landscape of each campaign could be different.</p>

</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>End</h2>
    <p>Does this scenario have an end? An impending end can add
    focus and intensity. And you can always create another campaign for the same PCs, unless you actually destroy the entire world. Or you can destroy the entire world. Isn't this fun?</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Drivers</h2>
    <p>These are patterns which help you write playable adventures.<p>
    <p>Fiction writers may sneer a &quot;formula&quot; fiction. But they have total control over
    their characters. When playing with your actual, live, creative, and surprising friends, you need
    some structure to let you plan some things in advance.</p>
    <p>A clear formula also helps the players and speeds up play. We've all had that slow starting
    game where the players can't quite find the adventure. So a little clarity makes everyone's live better.</p>
    <p>Of course, you can run any kind of adventure in your actual campaign. Drivers are an engine and a safety net, not a cage.</p>
    <p>You can also use these as inspiration, or as a design challenge. Pick two drivers, along with the
    culture, technology, and magic found in the world... then try to make it work.</p>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Agents</h3>
        <p>PCs work for someone who sends them on adventures. James Bond works for MI6. Rebels work for the Rebel Alliance. Brave knights work for their king. And Indiana Jones works for the archaeology department at Marshall College.</p>
        <p>PCs might be part of a rigid chain of command. Or they might be mostly independent and self
        motivated. The key is that adventures are part of their job.</p>
        <p>The PCs can be an elite team, or new recruits. Or they might work in an obscure corner of some vast bureaucracy.  And the varieties of jobs are endless. Consider The X-Files, Men in Black, Stargate, Sanctuary, Outland, Judge Dee, Agents of Shield, Battlestar Galactica, all the Star Treks, western sheriffs, Blade Runner, Mission Impossible, and Torchwood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Freelancers</h3>
        <p>Paid freelancers include Ghostbusters(tm), private detectives, bodyguards, bounty hunters, assassins, hackers, mercenaries, etc. PCs can be guns for hire, swords for hire, spells for hire, cyberdecks for hire, or have fast ships, or other vehicles, for hire.</p><p>The PCs are contacted by their customers, and paid to go on adventures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Privateers</h3>
        <p>Privateers were like pirates who operated during a war. They had permission from their side to attack and rob ships belonging to the other side. And the field of legalized crime is fertile ground
        for adventuring.</p>
        <p>In many fantasy RPGs, PCs seek out members of an &quot;enemy&quot; species, kill them, and take their stuff.</p>
        <p>Robin Hood was technially a bandit. But occupiers and oppressors can excuse plenty of fun and profitable crime.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Quest</h3>
        <p>A journey to achieve a goal. Quests may seek a magical treasure, a cure, or a personal fortune. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a quest to destroy the ring. Battlestar Galactica is a quest for the legendary lost colony and a new home. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Survival</h3>
        <p>PCs may be lost or marooned away from their own kind, trying to stay alive and find a way home. Castaways can be transported by fantastic means and can find themselves in very strange places. Examples: John Carter of Mars Lost in Space, and Farscape. A large group of castaways might turn into a colony. And exiles are deliberate castaways.</p>
        <p>Or PCs might man a lonely outpost in a dangerous land, or simply try to stay a live in a deadly, futuristic urban wasteland. PCs might be hated, hunted, or tracked by a relentless foe.
        Survival might also depend on meeting a special need, such as a vampire's need for blood.</p>
        <p>Survivors explore their environment, fight off attackers, and seek vital resources. They meet
        new friends and allies, and new enemies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Personal Mission</h3>
        <p>Or &quot;personal quest&quot;. The PCs are doing something because they just really want to do it, or because they deeply believe it should be done.</p><p>They are driven to become the world's greatest swordsman, to advance science, prove the Hollow Earth is real, or bring back Atlantis.</p><p>A PC with a personal quest and a personal fortune can employ like-minded PCs as Agents.</p>
        <p>The PCs' personal mission could also be an extended hunt or mystery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Escape</h3>
        <p>A kind of Quest. A desperate journey to Anywhere Else. Powerful, but best for short campaigns.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Merchants</h3>
        <p>Business isn't always boring. Think of the early spice traders in Earth’s Age of Exploration, the caravans along the Silk Road, or maybe the fur traders of the American frontier.</p></p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Keys Quest</h3>
        <p>A classic… The Great Magic Thing was divided into parts. The parts were scattered and hidden in dangerous places. And the PCs have a reason to find them.</p><p>Like all quests, it has a final end. But it has a bunch of intermediate ends, too. Twelve parts automatically gives you twelve adventures. Stretch it to a few adventures per part and you can get a whole year of play.</p><p>It’s over-used. But it’s over-used because it works.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Wandering Heroes</h3>
        <p>PCs have explicitly signed up to fight evil and help those in need. Examples: Knights of the Round Table, Dr. Who, The A-Team.</p><p>This is a popular classic. But make sure the players explicitly agree to it, because it requires the PCs to do dangerous things without any other rational motivation.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Treasure Hunters</h3>
        <p>Treasure hunting is popular in fiction and a straightforward source of adventures.</p><p>However, treasure hunters who are after the Big Score either get tired of failing, or succeed and retire. So don't count on treasure hunting alone for a long campaign.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Toys and Treasures</h2>
   
    <p>Imaginary toys should be awesome.</p>
    <p>Imagine a player saying, "My character has an XYZ", or, "We use the XYZ". If you imagined them
    smiling when they said it, your campaign needs the XYZ.</p>
    <p>Of course, awesome doesn't have to mean powerful and perfect. Ask anyone to name three D&amp;D wands, and
    one of them is sure to be Wand of Wonder.</p>
    <p>Common categories include...</p>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Weapons</h3>
        <p>Players like weapons. Big weapons. Powerful weapons. Strange and surprising weapons.
        Weapons that have unusual effects, or which make silly noises.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Ammunition</h3>
        <p>Finding your third +1 sword isn't exciting. But everyone wants another box of grenades. Ammunition, potions, rare spell components, dilithium crystals, and other useful consumables are 
        a GM's friend.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Defenses</h3>
        <p>It's easier for players to move beyond just killing everything if they don't actually have to.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Healing</h3>
        <p>Medic!!!</p>
        <p>PCs care about anyone or anything that can heal their combat damage. And healing potions
        and med-paks are a consumable resource, too.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Toys that don't kill people. Or at least can do other things, besides killing people.</p>
        <p>Since weapons have a head start on coolness, try to pump up the awesomeness of your world's tools.
        And give yourself and extra pat on the back when the PCs solve a problem with a tool instead of
        their weapons.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Spells</h3>
        <p>Spells names and effects should reinforce the overall style of the game world. They can be
        baroque, practical, horrific, playful, flashy, subtle, etc. Magic is whatever you want it to be.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Magic Items</h3>
        <p>See Spells for notes on style.</p>
        <p>And magic items excel at quirkiness and unpredictability. They can do whatever you want... it's
        magic. And you decide who gets to use them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Vehicles</h3>
        <p>Vehicles are a great enabler, especially flying ones.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Animals</h3>
        <p>Riding animals, witch's and wizard's familiars, etc. They are useful. And they are NPCs
        which you can play.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Magic Powers</h3>
        <p>Faeries, werewolves, and superheros all have special powers that make them fun to play.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Natural abilities</h3>
        <p>Wings, gills, night vision, etc. Also consider extreme yet non-magial abilities, such as those
        of the Mentats and Bene Gesserit of Frank Herbert's Dune.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Cyber Powers</h3>
        <p>We can rebuild you... with extra awesomeness.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Humans can learn to do many things. And being exceptionally good at something is pretty cool.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>Players care about increasing skills. Use that interest. You
        can have mentors, apprenticeships, schools, guilds, and the secret technique of any group.</p>
        <p>And magic and cyberpunk offer their own special options.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Social status</h3>
        <p>People like you, or obey you, or fear you, or at least have a taboo against killing you, etc.</p>
        <p>Usually, status comes with membership in some group.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>Authority</h3>
        <p>Like social status, but with teeth. Of course, there may be situations in which the authority
        doesn't apply...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="short-hint">
        <h3>And more...</h3>
        <p>This list isn't complete. What's missing?</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Places</h2>
    <p>Describe some places where the action happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Sides</h2>
    <p>Anyone with interests different enough that you might have to negotiate with them.</p>
    <p>Groups can include all the PCs, some of the PCs, or none of the PCs. They can be friends or foes,
    large or small, familiar or strange, and strong or weak.</p>
    <p>These are sources of many NPCs. Do yourself a favor and make them fun to play</p>

    <h2>Example PCs</h2>
    <p>Describe a few PCs you might enjoy playing. These don't have to be wonderful or iconic or anything. They point is just to see how easy (or hard) it is to create fun PCs in this world.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Adventures</h2>
    <p>How can you run some of these classic adventure types?</p>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Assault</h3>
        Attack a place to achieve a goal. Often there&apos;s a planning an preparation phase, followed by sneaking and/or combat, sometimes followed by running away.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Siege</h3>
        Defend a place, and maybe some NPCs, a valuable location, etc. Common phases are discovering the threat,  finding and reaching the refuge, preparing defenses, and multiple waves of attacks with recovery and repair in between. PCs might be rescued by sunrise or the cavalry. Or they might weaken their foes enough to make a run for it, or even just win outright.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Recon</h3>
        Go somewhere dangerous. Gather information to help plan future action. Get out alive.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Rescue</h3>
        Get a person or people (or creatures) safely away from people (or creatures) who are holding them prisoner. The people you rescue might be weak or strong, helpful or difficult.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Theft</h3>
        Get a thing from the other side, without necessarily having to fight them.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Escape</h3>
        PCs have been captured. Most of their equipment has been taken away. And now they try to get away. Escapes can be a nice change of pace where the PCs concentrate on getting <b>out</b> of a place instead of getting <b>in</b>. Other adventures can turn into escapes if the PCs are captured. And a successful escape can double as a recon or an all out assault from within. 
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Gauntlet</h3>
        The PCs have to get from point A to point B, possibly while transporting something or someone. And lots of nasties will try to stop them. A gauntlet adventure usually has a linear form, and a clear goal. The pace is fast because the PCs will lose if the enemy has time to organize and concentrate its forces. The theme is overwhelming odds... just not faced all at once. :-)
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Hunt</h3>
        The PCs track/stalk/chase something that (initially) hides and runs away. The hunt can be literal or metaphorical. And the tables might be turned. But the PCs are generally the pursuers. The PCs can themselves be hunted. But this is harder to run and works best when combined with other adventure types.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Monster Mystery</h3>
        Bad things are happening. Investigate. Find the monster. Deal with it.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Mystery</h3>
        As in mystery fiction. Sherlock Holmes, etc. PCs are detectives who investigate and solve the mystery.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Explore</h3>
        Visit all the parts of a dangerous place to find out what&apos;s there. Classic dungeon crawling is Treasure Hunters and Privateers Exploring an underground setting.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Capture</h3>
        A Hunt in which someone or something must be taken alive. This is often more complicated than just killing them.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Trick</h3>
        And elaborate deception or &quot;con&quot;. The PCs must design, prepare, and execute all the parts of a plan. Each step is played out under that constant threat of being discovered. And the PCs might have to improvise if something unexpected happens.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Negotiate</h3>
