<h1>RPG World Builder</h1>

<div id="try-it">
    <a href="rpgworldbuilder.html" target="_blank">Try it!</a>
</div>

<p>Do you have ideas for roleplaying games, but wonder if you can turn
them into something you can really play with your friends?</p>

<p>Are you an experienced GM, with experience running a few different rules systems,
and maybe one or two you've created yourself?</p>

<p>If you answered yes to both questions above, this site is for you. The tool on the next page
will help you flesh out you idea, and ensure that it has what it takes to drive weeks of 
enjoyable campaigning.</p>

<p>I call this a world builder and a campaign creator because it's about setting and situation, not rules.
You already own books full of rules. You can get free and universal systems online. And you can probably write some yourself if you have to.</p>

<p>The hard part is to come up with ideas that are:</p>
<ol><li>Creative and exciting</li><li>Practical and playable</li></ol>

<p>Below, I list the fields on the form and explain what they are and how they work.</p>

<p>You can create an account to save your work. And if you create an account, you can also
clone and modify other peoples' ideas, or add them into your own.</p>

<p>On to the fields...</p>

<div class="field">
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Always include a working title. It's evocative. And it's the name that appears on a saved campaign.
    And you can change it any time you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Seed Text</h2>
    <p>This is the image or fragement or concept that you thought might make a good game. This field
    should be totally free-form, stream-of-consciousness, without any hint of structure or planning.
    We'll do that later.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>It's easier to have exciting events in the PCs'
    lives when the world itself is changing. For a shorter campaign, a change
    can define the setting. War, exploration, the rise of magic, the vanishing of magic, or the
    Zombie Apocylipse. Don't be afraid to drop the PCs into Interesting Times(TM).</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Mood</h2>
    <p>Grim, exciting, zany, lyrical, tactical, dream-like, happy, sad, desparate, exuberent, etc. How will the players feel?</p>
    <p>Your game will produce <em>some</em> feeling. So make it intentional.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Visual Style</h2>
    <p>How do you see it in your mind? Does it look like a favorite movie, comic, artist, etc.?</p>
    <p>You can use this as inspriation for many details later on.</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>A city, a planet, a war, a subculture, etc.</p>
    <p>Try larger or smaller physical scopes than you are used to.</p>
    <p>And scope isn't just an area on a map. A single great city could be the setting for campaigns about
    court intrigue, ambition among wizards, and about shape changers living in the shadows and sewers. But the limits and rules and social landscape of each campaign could be different.</p>

</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>End</h2>
    <p>Does this scenario have an end? An impending end can add
    focus and intensity. And you can always create another campaign for the same PCs, unless you actually destroy the entire world. Or you can destroy the entire world. Isn't this fun?</p>
</div>
<div class="field">
    <h2>Drivers</h2>
    <p>These are pattens which help you write playable adventures.<p>
    <p>Fiction writers may sneer a &quot;formula&quot; fiction. But they have total control over
    their characters. When playing with your actual, live, creative, and surprising friends, you need
    some structure to let you plan some things in advance.</p>
    <p>And a clear formula also helps the players and speeds up play. We've all had that slow starting
    game where the players can't quite find the adventure. So a little clarity makes everyone's live better.</p>
    <p>You can also use these as inspiration, or as a design challenge. Pick two drivers, along with the
    culture, technology, and magic found in the world... then try to make it work.</p>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Agents</h3>
        <p>PCs work for someone who sends them on adventures. James Bond works for MI6. Rebels work for the Rebel Alliance. Brave knights work for their king. And Indiana Jones works for the archeology deprtment at Marshall College.</p>
        <p>PCs might be part of a ridgid chain of command. Or they might be mostly independant and self
        motivated. The key is that adventures are part of thei job.</p>
        <p>The PCs can be an elite team, or new recruits. Or they might work in an obscure corner of some vast bureaucracy.  And the varieties of jobs are endless. Consider The X-Files, Men in Black, Stargate, Sanctuary, Outland, Judge Dee, Agents of Shield, Battlestar Galactica, all the Star Treks, western sherifs, Blade Runner, Mission Impossible, and Torchwood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Secret War</h3>
        <p>The secret part allows the setting to look like our everyday world. (Or the everyday medieval world, etc.)</p><p>Secret War is often combined with Agents. But PCs can be pulled into a fight without formally signing up: Vampires vs Werewolves, Imortals vs Imortals, etc. Characters can be part of one side by birth, or sucked in when they learn the secret.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Freelancers</h3>
        <p>Paid freelancers include Ghostbusters(tm), private detectives, bodyguards, bounty hunters, assassins, hackers, mercenaries, etc. PCs can be guns for hire, swords for hire, spells for hire, cyberdecks for hire, or have fast ships, or other vehicles, for hire.</p><p>The PCs are contacted by their customers, and paid to go on adventures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Privateers</h3>
        <p>Privateers were like pirates who operated during a war. They had permission from their side to attack and rob ships belonging to the other side. And the field of legalized crime is fertile ground
        for adventuring.</p>
        <p>In many fantasy RPGs, PCs seek out members of an &quot;enemy&quot; species, kill them, and take their stuff.</p>
        <p>Robin Hood was technially a bandit. But occupiers and opressors can exuse plenty of fun and profitable crime.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Quest</h3>
        <p>A journey to achieve a goal. Quests may seek a magical treasure, a cure, or a personal fortune. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a quest to destroy the ring. Battlestar Galactica is a quest for the legendary lost colony and a new home. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Survival</h3>
        <p>PCs may be lost or marooned away from their own kind, trying to stay alive and find a way home. Castaways can be transported by fantastic means and can find themselves in very strange places. Examples: John Carter of Mars Lost in Space, and Farscape. A large group of castaways might turn into a colony. And exiles are deliberate castaways.</p>
        <p>Or PCs might man a lonely outpost in a dangerous land, or simply try to stay a live in a deadly, futuristic urban wasteland. PCs might be hated, hunted, or tracked by a relentless foe.</p>
        <p>Survivors explore their environment, fight off attackers, and seek vital resources. They meet
        new friends and allies, and new enemies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Personal Mission</h3>
        <p>Or &quot;personal quest&quot;. The PCs are doing something because they just really want to do it, or because they deeply believe it should be done.</p><p>They are driven to become the worlds greatest swordsman, to advance science, prove the Hollow Earth is real, or bring back Atlanntis.</p><p>A PC with a personal quest and a personal fortune can employ like-minded PCs in Jobs With Missions.</p>
        <p>The PCs' personal mission could also be an extended hunt or mystery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Need</h3>
        <p>The PCs have a dire need, which might or might not be shared with the rest of the world. Vampires need blood. Everyone needs water on a desert planet. Drasitic action is taken to find, obtain, and protect the vital resource.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Escape</h3>
        <p>A kind of Quest. A desperate journey to Anywhere Else. Powerful, but best for short campaigns.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Merchants</h3>
        <p>business isn't always boring. Think of the early spice traders in Earth’s Age of Exploration, the caravans along the Silk Road, or maybe the fur traders of the American frontier.</p></p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Keys Quest</h3>
        <p>A classic… The Great Magic Thing was divided into parts. The parts were scattered and hidden in dangerous places. And the PCs have a reason to find them.</p><p>Like all quests, it has a final end. But it has a bunch of intermediate ends, too. Twelve parts automatically gives you twelve adventures. Stretch it to a few adventures per part and you can get a whole year of play.</p><p>It’s over-used. But it’s over-used because it works.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Wandering Heros</h3>
        <p>PCs have explicitly signed up to fight evil and help those in need. Examples: Knights of the Round Table, Dr. Who, The A-Team.</p><p>This is a popular classic. But make sure the players explicitly agree to it, because it requires the PCs to do dangerous things without any other rational motivation.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Hunted</h3>
        <p>Being personally hunted, or belonging to a hunted group, is kind of a downer by itself. But it's a great addition to some other drivers. PCs can be motivated by a goal up ahead and a danger behind.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        <h3>Treasure Hunters</h3>
        <p>Treasure hunters is popular in fiction and a straightforward source of adventures.</p><p>However, treasure hunters who are after the Big Score either get tired of failing, or succeed and retire. So don't count on treasure hunting alone for a long campaign.</p>
    </div>
